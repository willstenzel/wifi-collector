Team meeting held on 14/12/2019 at 14:00 in the cafe

Attending:
  - Michal Bernacki
  - Will Stenzel
  - Tomasz Tatara


Moderator: Tomasz Tatara
Minutes: Michal Bernacki

Agenda:
 1.- Work together on robustness and Ctr-D functionality
 2.- Check memory organisation with Valgrind

================================================================================

- We encountered some problems with export and import functionality, and
  discussed together how to solve it
- Tomek started implementing Ctr-D functionality in main menu, while Michal and
  Will discussed how to implement it in each of submenus
- When Tomek was done with Ctr-D in main menu, we all worked on Ctr-D in submenus
- Tomek noticed the even though Ctr-D works in export and import, binary
  files with random names are created so we improved robustness of those two
  functions to prevent it from happening ever again
- While testing memory with Valgrind, we noticed that some of the memory may be
  leaked in import function and Will pointed out that we are not closing the
  file after reading, adding fclose() function solved the problem
- When Tomek tried to run code on Debian distribution Ctr-D functionality didn't
  work as expected
- We decided to split the remaining work and talk tomorrow to wrap up the final
  version of the project
